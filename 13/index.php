# Type conversion functions: PHP provides specific functions to convert values between different data types. Some of the most common conversion functions are intval(), floatval() and strval(). These functions take a value as an argument and return the value converted to the desired type. Here is an example:

$number = "123";
$number = intval($number);  // Convert the string to an integer
echo $number;  // Outputs: 123

//In this example, the intval() function is used to convert the string 123 to an integer. The result is stored in the $number variable and then printed on the screen.
