<?php

// Defining and declaring variables

// The variable name is case-sensitive, which means that $age and $Age would be considered two different variables.

// Here is an example of how to declare and use variables in PHP:

$name = "Roni";
$age = 34;

echo "Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.";

// In the example, we used echo to display the message in the HTML, an important item is that to display the message it is necessary to use double quotes because this way it is possible to concatenate variables and strings.
