<?php
# Objects are instances of classes, which are more complex data structures that contain properties and methods. We can create objects using the new keyword, followed by the class name, example:

$object = new stdClass();  // An object


// Note: stdClass is a predefined class in PHP that is used to create generic objects without needing to declare a custom class. It is a base class that provides a simple container for storing properties and their values.
